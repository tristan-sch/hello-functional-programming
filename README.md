# hello-functionnal-programming

This project my assignment for Module 4:

- Go to the [guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/5f133439b279dc27c467cad7)
- Go to the [live demo](https://hello-functional-programming.vercel.app/)

## The assignment

I decided to keep it simple and reuse some of my work for the last project so it’s a simple weather app. Here’s what I learned:

### `Pure functions`

- Avoid side effects -> anything that a function might do that isn’t computing its output from the inputs you’ve given and returning that output.

### `Higher-order functions`

- Functions that can take as inputs other functions or a function that can return a function as its output -> we treat functions kind of as objects themselves

### `Don’t iterate`

- Use map, reduce, filter and not for, while

## Notes

- I mostly used the presentation from Anjana Vakil for this assignment, I think it has it all and everything is really well explained.
